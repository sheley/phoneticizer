this is the first little program I am making entirely on my own without following any sort of tutorial or instructions from a class, etc.

I got inspired to just try this out because the other night my friends and I entertained ourselves trying to guess and subsequently quizzing each other to recite the words that represent the letters of the alphabet phonetically.

I want to make it so that I can enter a word, and later an entire message, and have the phonetic alphabet representation for the word (and later the message).

That's all! I am trying to figure it out as much as possible on my own!
